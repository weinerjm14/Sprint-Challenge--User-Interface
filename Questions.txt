5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git allows for versioning, remote collaboration, and rolling back of code. It allows a team to work together without over-writing each other's code using branching or cloning (or both). It is better than email back and forth since it is not reliant on someone looking at who is working on what to begin to make their own changes. It also allows for sharing public projects for community collaboration using tools like gitHub or BitBucket, which is especially important for open-source projects.
